- ### Frontend Architecture
  - ### Overview
  
    The front end is built using React, on AWS Amplify to simplify front end management. When a developer commits code to CodeCommit, AWS Amplify will trigger the inbuilt CI/CD pipeline to deploy the change to the application. The developer can store the settings in the amplify.yml file. Amplify will also provide CDN, password protection, cache invalidation, redirection services etc., without the need to manage any EC2 instances or setup additional services for front end management.
